# Solid Namespace
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/project-Solid-7C4DFF.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/solid/solid)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/solid-namespace.svg?style=flat)](https://npm.im/solid-namespace)

A collection of common RDF namespaces used in the Solid project.

solid-namespace can be used with any RDF/JS-compatible library (e.g. [rdflib.js](/linkeddata/rdflib.js)).


## Usage

You can use this library in two ways. 

1. With a RDF JS library to get NamedNodes
2. Without a library to get url strings

### With a rdf library

If a rdf library is provided then the map of namespaces given will be the result of calling `$rdf.namedNode` on the namespace urls.

```js
const $rdf = require('rdflib');
const ns = require('solid-namespace')($rdf);
const store = $rdf.graph();

let me = ...;
let name = store.any(me, ns.vcard('fn')) || store.any(me, ns.foaf('name'));

console.log(ns.foaf('name')); // -> NamedNode(<http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name>)
```

### Without a rdf library

```js
const ns = require('solid-namespace')();
console.log(ns.foaf('name')); // -> "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name"
```

## Vocabularies included

The vocabularies included in this repo are endorsed by [the Solid leader](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/solid-team.md#solid-leader), and are recommended to use in Solid projects. Below are the vocabularies listed with a short explanation of intent.

Regardless of whether information is in people's heads, in physical or digital documents, or in the form of factual data, it can be linked. FOAF integrates three kinds of network: *social networks* of human collaboration, friendship and association; *representational networks* that describe a simplified view of a cartoon universe in factual terms, and *information networks* that use Web-based linking to share independently published descriptions of this inter-connected world. FOAF does not compete with socially-oriented Web sites; rather it provides an approach in which different sites can tell different parts of the larger story, and by which users can retain some control over their information in a non-proprietary format. |
